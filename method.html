            <p id=p1>The concept I work through is about Gender Inequality, which I spontaneously happened in my head on the day I received teacher's brief. As a person usually concerns about social affairs, I aim to convey messages in order to awake people's awareness about surrounding issues. Hence, whenever I have a chance to create something using visual effect, I would like to choose topics related to social commentary. So for the theme "Gender Inequality" this time, I sketched a crying woman with two hands covering her face. She is a patient of violation as we can see the bleeding wounds in her arms. But she couldn't talk because of many reasons which are so-called generally social prejudice.</p>

            <p id=p2>
            This concept is supportively followed by the Dada style because of mutual figures. How? We need to understand that Dada was a form of artistic anarchy born out of disgust for the social, political and cultural values. It brought a negative reaction which sought to offend rather than to impress. Such perception was more of a protest movement than a style of art, and the fact was it used for sarcasm. To place this in my concept, I wanted to emphasize the evil side of society since they put a frame on women, even including the distinction of the social status (violence against women). And I tried to choose suitable elements and layout to express them in the best way. </p>
                
            <p id=p3>By using a dark red background, I intended to portray the depression and fairness of the girl. If you look closer to her eyes, you could see the angriness. It meant the women understand this inequality, but they didn't know how to escape. Such clearly exposed by the text I put around her. These words were divided into six paragraphs, from different directions plug into the body of the woman like the prison bars. And this also demonstrated one of the main characteristics of Dada style: text was from somewhere to anywhere. The text was also a poem writing for gender equality I chose white text for more legible and readable. Indeed, I also use san-serif fonts (there was just the word "INEQUALITY" used serif font, because people mostly used san-serif fonts in Dada style. You can see two effects applied to the title "Gender Inequality", and I made them match with the sound inserted. You can hear each tone of the piano song along with the appearance of each word GENDER, combined with glitch sound effect bringing the mimicry, like other Dada's visuals. And there was the sound of raining in the piano's song, so I inserted a gif of rain. This also enhanced the sadness of the woman.</p>

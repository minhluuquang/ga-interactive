            What is gender?<br>
            Is gender an identity?<br>
            Certainly gender is not a choice.<br>
            But gender is shaped, molded to young new minds,<br>
            strings hang from children's joints to dance as society tells them<br>
            No matter man or woman, we are born into roles. 
        </p>

        <p id="poem2">
            The woman, the one whose mind stands and pleads on her legs, bring about equality <br>
            But whose body reacts not out of her own accordance and moves <br>
            Moves, graceful, gentle, elegant, and FEMININE.<br>
            As society tells her, she is a woman, and that is her role. <br>
            Where she wishes to stomp, she stands on her tiptoes. <br>
            Where she wishes to thrash, she glides across the floor. <br>
            A puppet bound by the hands of society, pushing, pushing <br>
            To free herself, to change what being a woman means, <br>
            what (gender) equality means.
        </p>
        
        <p id="poem3">
            The man, he is to castrated by the hands to be a MAN.<br>
            What does that mean? Better put, what does that mean to society?<br>
            I don't dance.<br>
            I am the example to others, and know how to do everything<br>
            I don't feel things, or at least show them, because that is not what I do.<br>
            I am powerful and MANLY,<br>
            funny that should be made into an adjective...<br>
            But, I am not one who should be played with like a puppet, much like the woman,<br>
            I do have feelings, but they cannot be expressed for society tells me I will be seen otherwise,<br>
            I don't know everything even when I'm expected to,<br>
            I have my pride as a man, and am no one's puppet, I too wish to change the meaning of “man”.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p id="poem4">
            But strip us down, wash away our skin, we are bare, we are the same,<br>
            INSIDE<br>
            What makes us, us?<br>
            Is it our gender?<br>
            Is it society?<br>
            No, what makes us, what makes you, is ultimately your decision,<br>
            and thats something, not even society, can take away from you.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p id="poem5">
            I am so tired of doing so much work and your unfair pay<br>
            I am so shocked by your un-deterrent laws and sentences<br>
            I am so disgusted by your blind eyes<br>
            Looking the other way when you see them pushing us<br>
            We are beaten; we are burned, stabbed,<br>
            We are sold; we are raped, and killed<br>
            In times of peace and in times of war<br>
            We are powerless.<br>
            They have it all and they have us<br>
            We are the impoverished<br>
            We are the racially profiled<br>
            We are the stigmatized<br>
            We are the so-called mental health patients<br>
        </p>
        
        <p id="poem6">
            I speechless when you don't show up<br>
            Where are you when you hear us screaming?<br>
            Where are you when you see us beaten?<br>
            Where are you when we speak about harassment at work?<br>
            Where are you when our daughters are abused on dates?<br>
            Where are you when they call us names?<br>
            Where are you when they take our children away?<br>
            Where are you when they leave the courts free and inflict further harm upon us?<br>
            Where are you when the court orders are unobserved?<br>
            Where are you when one of us ends up in a wheelchair?<br>
            Where are you when one of us is disfigured?<br>
            Where are you when we are raped and gang-raped<br>
